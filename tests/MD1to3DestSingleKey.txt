ught I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driv purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thoCall me Ishmael. Some years agoâ€”never mind how long preciselyâ€”having little or no money in myienever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of euth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whng off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mov stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peopleâ€™s hats offâ€”then, I account it high  a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberatelyery funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requiresttake to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly ime to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical dd by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefsâ€”commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, thw is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted rounegree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There noeious were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of aves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours prev streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by wanels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leward. What do you see?â€”Posted like silent senti dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northaiving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and phina; some high aloft in the rigging, as if strning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from Clore crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content ne? What do they here?

But look! here come masterâ€”tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gotr as they possibly can without falling in. And there they standâ€”miles of themâ€”leagues. Inlanders all, ce. No. They must get just as nigh the watehem but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffite needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

Once more. Say you are in the country;. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of thhey come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenuesâ€”north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite ream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveriesâ€”stand thand leaves you there by a pool in the stin some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, at in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysicalat region. Should you ever be athirst man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all th t, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief eleist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietesprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.

But here is an artmattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy wae within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cent he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix wery its sighs like leaves upon this shepherdâ€™s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherdâ€™s eye  lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picturewis the one charm wanting?â€”Waterâ€”there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract  of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-liliesâ€”what ere fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scoresother to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Benly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whef sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddepassenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship werrazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a ach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other cethis is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he coarate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all  now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a sepud oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.

Now, when t same image, we ourselves see in all rivers anld not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But thaI have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a pu over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to berenjoy themselves much, as a general thing;â€”no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of relsomeâ€”donâ€™t sleep of nightsâ€”do not se, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sickâ€”grow quaramy part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. Itsuch offices to those who like them. For  salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of  k,â€”though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-boardâ€”ye, and what not. And as for going as coois quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schoonerst will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolted and peppered, there is no one who, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;â€”though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salads.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the fommies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramitrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the murnd at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches oneâ€™s sense of honor, particulamp from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. Aecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me juryour hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest icanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting ly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardbics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.

What of it, if some old hun, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stooys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailorkent? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respec to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testams of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amounttowever they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; thahowever the old sea-captains may order me aboutâ€”hfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ainâ€™t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, tp is passed round, and all hands should rub each otherâ€™s shoulder-blades, and be content.

Again, I apoint of view, that is; and so the universal thum everybody else is one way or other served in much the same wayâ€”either in a physical or metaphysical lf. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world betweeny passengers a single penny that I ever heard oways go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pa ”what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, cond thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,â€paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orcharsly we consign ourselves to perdition!

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome ea monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfulidering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can xiolate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere ainds from astern (that is, if you never vercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than wters in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that afte way do the commonalty lead their lead second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the sameicer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some uvoyage; this the invisible police offr having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling nat was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more exg voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence thaccountable wayâ€”he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whalintates. â€œWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. â€œBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.â€

Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused discriminating judgment.

Chief among these motives esides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and tending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other mameless perils of the whale; these, with all the atall my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, neden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, anding itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidn, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlast eason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world sl the inmates of the place one lodges in.

CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag. soul, endless processions of the whale, and,ung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost
hatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon le Pacific. Quitting the good city of old ManI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and theast young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark  offer, till the following Monday.

As morning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place wouldoaft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, to sail in no other than a Nantucket crn their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up woor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great originalâ€”the Tyre of this Carthage;â€ whaling, and though in this matter phich amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of”s to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous lse aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoethe place where the first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did thoio risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?

Now having a night, a day, and still another night following e whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough tttle sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestonesâ€”so goes the storyâ€”to throw at thbbious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very duefore me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment ood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north wSo, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stplace. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,â€”inâ€™t be too particular.

With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of â€œThe Crossmy dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and doth the darkness towards the southâ€”wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, e rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere elsf the â€œSword-Fish Inn,â€ there came such ferventd Harpoonsâ€â€”but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows oecause from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensistruck my foot against the flinty projections, be the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,â€”rather weary for me, when I v Ishmael, said I at last; donâ€™t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stoppiunds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on,e and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the soninns.

Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle,ess, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest g the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtl resently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly  of the town proved all but deserted. But plike a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarterohe porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed I did was to stumble over an ash-box in tpen. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing cyself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.

It seemed the great of â€œThe Trap.â€ However, I picked mity, Gomorrah? But â€œThe Crossed Harpoons,â€ and â€œThe Sword-Fish?â€â€”this, then must needs be the sign  in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacherâ€™s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the wlack Angel of Doom was beating a bookBlack Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a became to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and ainment at the sign of â€˜The Trap!â€™

Moving on, I at last eping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertlthâ€”â€œThe Spouter Inn:â€”Peter Coffin.â€

Coffin?â€”Spouter?â€”Rather ominous in that particula tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneaooking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing arand the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself loe is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim,  connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter heroght that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.

It was a queer sortsign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thouked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging  oclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paulâ€™s tossed craft. Euroclydon, neverta sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Eurof placeâ€”a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on hEuroclydon,â€ says an old writerâ€”of whose works I possess the only copy extantâ€”â€œit maketh a marbed. â€œIn judging of that tempestuous wind called eless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for vless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.â€ Truside, or whether thou observest it from that sashellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outethe house. What a pity they didnâ€™t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little ese eyes are windows, and this body of mine is  enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mindâ€”old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, thlillion years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaktone is on, and the chips were carted off a mint here and there. But itâ€™s too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the copesitempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapperâ€”(he had a redder one aftermouth, and yet that would not keep out the ng off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his wonservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.

But what thinks Lazarus? Cr oriental summer climes of everlasting cards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of theia lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in oratra than here? Would he not far rathern he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumdt an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice pives, this is more wonderful than thaer to keep out this frost?

Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dare going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frostd tears of orphans.

But no more of this blubbering now, we alace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepien a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of somEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself id feet, and see what sort of a place this â€œSpouterâ€ may be.






CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
eviewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiay defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you  condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every wrmost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you aly of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountids the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might nd especially by throwing open the little window towarneate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, anothe picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, sq black mass of something hovering in the centre of t be altogether unwarranted.

But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,uairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvello-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite, halfuatural combat of the four primal elements.â€”Itâ€™s a blasted heath.â€”Itâ€™s a Hyperborean winter scene Black Sea in a midnight gale.â€”Itâ€™s the unns painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.â€”Itâ€™s the.dst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to ne portentous something in the pictureâ€™s miâ€”Itâ€™s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that oaated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Hory of my own, partly based upon the aggreg gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?

In fact, the artistâ€™s design seemed this: a final theog to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.

Thsible; and an exasperated whale, purposinrner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone vieesembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast haere thickly set with glittering teeth r opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some wnibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed withzed, and wondered what monstrous canndle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you ga s ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoonâ€”so ns. With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty yearthese were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapole tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, ann off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh thike a corkscrew nowâ€”was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slaidt central chimney with fireplaces all roundâ€”you enter the public room. A still duskier place is twayâ€”cut through what in old times must have been a grea at last was found imbedded in the hump.

Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched h of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a fancy you trod some old craftâ€™s cockpits, especiallyis, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost  the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking denâ€”the barâ€”a rude attempt at a right whaleâm this wide worldâ€™s remotest nooks. Projecting fromlong, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered fro€elves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby sh™s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whaleâ€™s jaw, so wide, a coach aand death.

Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true cylinders withoutâ€ their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums nother cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for”und these footpadsâ€™ goblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more; l meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surrowithin, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Paralleagathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I sought the landlord,g the place I found a number of young seamen nd so on to the full glassâ€”the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.

Upon enterin ed, tapping his forehead, â€œyou haint no objections to sharing a harpooneerâ€™s blanket, have ye? I sâ€™pt a bed unoccupied. â€œBut avast,â€ he addand telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was fullâ€”noo should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really er liked to sleep two in a bed; that if Ise you are goinâ€™ a-whalinâ€™, so youâ€™d better get used to that sort of thing.â€

I told him that I nevhght, I would put up with the half of any decent manâ€™s blanket.

â€œI thought so. All right; take a seat. S about a strange town on so bitter a niad no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander furtherue end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently workiner like a bench on the Battery. At onpper?â€”you want supper? Supperâ€™ll be ready directly.â€

I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all ovge of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Icelandâ€”no fire at allâ€nâ€™t make much headway, I thought.

At last some four or fiv away at the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he did”hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most sg sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and the landlord said he couldnâ€™t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a windinuhese dumplings in a most direful manner.

â€œMy boy,â€ said the landlord, â€œyouâ€™ll have the nig young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to tbstantial kindâ€”not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! Onehnny, â€œthe harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he donâ€™tâ€”he eats no€œOh, no,â€ said he, looking a sort of diabolically futmare to a dead sartainty.â€

â€œLandlord,â€ I whispered, â€œthat aint the harpooneer is it?â€

âtâ€ was the answer.

I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this â€œdark complexionedoneer? Is he here?â€

â€œHeâ€™ll be here afore long,hing but steaks, and he likes â€™em rare.â€

â€œThe devil he does,â€ says I. â€œWhere is that harpoâper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resohe must undress and get into bed before I did.

Sup€ harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, lpusâ€™s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a three yearsâ€™ voyage, and a full ship.ting up, the landlord cried, â€œThatâ€™s the Gramved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.

Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Star lled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled n the entry; the door was flung open, and in roHurrah, boys; now weâ€™ll have the latest news from the Feegees.â€

A tramping of sea boots was heard iied from their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straighton of bears from Labrador. They had just landn woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an erupti ed of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which hed them out brimmers all round. One complainwake for the whaleâ€™s mouthâ€”the barâ€”when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poure n the weather side of an ice-island.

The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even wer caught off the coast of Labrador, or oswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whethihat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yd, however, that one of them held somewth the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.

I observeehould soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I we the sea-gods had ordained that he st upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and sincich brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the cooulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen sull here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shntherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Ahim much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Soutrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give le became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and bein slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till hleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this mange in pursuit of him.

It was now about nine oâ€™clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quon! whereâ€™s Bulkington?â€ and darted out of the hous, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of â€œBulkington! Bulkingtiers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I d previous to the entrance of the seamen.

No man prefet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me justoa strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was thing with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in nâ€™t know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleepeKings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, anno more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor re any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors dping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might bneer, the more I abominated the thought of slee cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.

The more I pondered over this harpooeto be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnightâ€”how could I tell frgetting late, and my decent harpooneer ought , would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was ore.â€

â€œJust as you please; Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and itâ€™s a pl€™t sleep with him. Iâ€™ll try the bench hem what vile hole he had been coming?

â€œLandlord! Iâ€™ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.â€”I shanâat, I say, and Iâ€™ll make ye snug enough.â€ So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerarpenterâ€™s plane there in the barâ€”waiguy rough board hereâ€â€”feeling of the knots and notches. â€œBut wait a bit, Skrimshander; Iâ€™ve got a ccast the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and shavings flew right and left; till at lhief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The Iown of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove ianing in the world could make eider d told him for heavenâ€™s sake to quitâ€”the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the plnt; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too shor the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.

I now took theinst the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found d the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space aga room was about four inches higher than the planed oneâ€”so there was no yoking them. I then placetm the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwin would never do at all, especially as another current frohat there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this pland march on himâ€”bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent kt harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldnâ€™t I steal as in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.

The devil fetch than, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!

Still, looking round methe next morning, so soon as I popped out of the roomockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what  shing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, Iâ€™ll wait awhile; he must d, I began to think that after all I might be cheriagain, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other personâ€™s bebhough the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my dfellows after allâ€”thereâ€™s no telling.

But te dropping in before long. Iâ€™ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good behlandlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my € It was now hard upon twelve oâ€™clock.

The arpooneer.

â€œLandlord!â€ said I, â€œwhat sort of a chap is heâ€”does he always keep such late hours?âc. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I donâ€™t see what on airth keeps him so late, unlessâ€”yes, heâ€™s the bird what catches the wormomprehension. â€œNo,â€ he answered, â€œgenerally heâ€™s an early birdâ€”airley to bed and airley to rise,wering rage. â€œDo you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Satis you are telling me?â€ getting into a to may be, he canâ€™t sell his head.â€

â€œCanâ€™t sell his head?â€”What sort of a bamboozingly story is thue couldnâ€™t sell it here, the marketâ€™s overstocked.â€

â€œWith what?â€ shouted I.

â€œWith heads to be€ said the landlord, â€œand I told him hrday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?â€

â€œThatâ€™s precisely it,â at yarn to meâ€”Iâ€™m not green.â€

â€œMay be not,â€ taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, â€œbut mly, â€œyouâ€™d better stop spinning thsure; ainâ€™t there too many heads in the world?â€

â€œI tell you what it is, landlord,â€ said I quite calIing into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlordâ€™s.

â€œItâ€™s broke aâ€™ready,â€ sa break it for him,â€ said I, now fly rayther guess youâ€™ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderinâ€™ his head.â€

â€œIâ€™llig up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-stormâ€”â€œlandlord, stop whittling. You and I must unhe canâ€™t sell it, I guess.â€

â€œLandlord,â€ said I, goind he.

â€œBroke,â€ said Iâ€”â€œbroke, do you mean?â€

â€œSartain, and thatâ€™s the very reason ds to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telyou can only give me half a one; that the other half belongerstand one another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me lt of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree. I now de towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowâ€”a soring me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feelingmrst place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take tespects safe to spend the night with him. And in the fiand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all ro to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.â€
d you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and Iâ€™ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; an
this here harpooneer I have been tellinâ€™ you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bough rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, â€œWall,â€ said the landlord, fetching a long breath, â€œthatâ€™s a purty long sarmon for a chap thattuse to-morrowâ€™s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellinâ€™ human heads about the streets when folks , and that one heâ€™s trying to sell to-night, ca up a lot of â€™balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and heâ€™s sold all on â€™em but oneithe airth like a string of inions.â€

This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and or with four heads strung on a string, for all s goinâ€™ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goinâ€™ out of the dosay night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idnk of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturdhowed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling meâ€”but at the same time what could I thio dreadful late, you had better be turning flukesâ€”itâ€™s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the the rejoinder. â€œBut come, itâ€™s gettinglators?

â€œDepend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.â€

â€œHe pays regâ€™lar,â€ was ed to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, ed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal usnight we were spliced. Thereâ€™s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; itâ€™s an almighty big baglim in a jiffy;â€ and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But  do. Come along here, Iâ€™ll give ye a nd somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldnâ€™tIome to anchor somewhereâ€”come along then; do come; wonâ€™t ye come?â€

I considered the matter a moment, anee that harpooneer to-night; heâ€™s c stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed â€œI vum itâ€™s Sundayâ€”you wonâ€™t sdany four harpooneers to sleep abreast.

â€œThere,â€ said the landlord, placing the candle on a c enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for  then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, surerm eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.

Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Tomfortable now, and good night to ye.â€ I turned round froazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; â€œthere, make yourself ch no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboaoom; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could seeough none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the rr; also a large seamanâ€™s bag, containing the harpooneerâ€™s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trmock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one cornerd representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hamuwhat is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, aa tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.

But nk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and ndges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. To nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the ed tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it thd get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on,uld it be possible that any sober harpooneer woulere was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But co ad been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I neverle damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer hto try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a litt mmenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bk.

I sat down on the side of the bed, and cosaw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the nece in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what ttook off my coat, and thought a little mored-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then hns and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
o more ado, but jumped out of my pantalooe landlord said about the harpooneerâ€™s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made n

At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land  a good deal, and could not sleep for aWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled aboutohat must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a w the door.

Lord save me, thinks I, tf Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from underohe bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began worki the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards trd till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other,ne while employed in unlacing the bagâ€™s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned roundâ€”whenerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some timg away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eag,€™s just as I thought, heâ€™s a terrible bedfellow; heâ€™s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, itâ good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there ers at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knht, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasthere he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the lige cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distanta white manâ€”a whaleman tooâ€”who, falling among thew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of  But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and co outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! Itâ€™s only hism tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhapical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sunâ€™spletely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropnever noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, ing through me like lightning, this harpooneer s the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passa took the New Zealand headâ€”a ghastly thing enoughâ€”and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off h old chest in the middle of the room, he thennd presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on theia small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a â€”none to speak of at leastâ€”nothing but s hatâ€”a new beaver hatâ€”when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his headms, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, butan ever I bolted a dinner.

Even as it waildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker th ed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himse of fear, and being completely nonplusswhat to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parentldemand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.

Meanwhile, he continued the businesenough just then to address him, and f who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game swas all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Yearsâ€™ War, and just esc checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too,  of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him wereas. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whalf dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palmped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel oemight take a fancy to mineâ€”heavens! look at that tomahawk!

But there was no time for shuddering,of heads tooâ€”perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He man in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler  o, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, aat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy gregfor now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me thnmbalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some sim of a three daysâ€™ old Congo baby. Remembering the ed produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colourioden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wolar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished i very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his  The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside wereng the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons.C about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; ”to see what was next to follow.

But the interval I spent in delibes high time, now or never, before thehibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it waris mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light waf it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with hating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head os astonishment he began feeling me.

Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from  out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sanghponses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.

â€œSpeak-e! tell-eshing about me in the dark.

â€œLandlord, for Godâ€™s s last saidâ€”â€œyou no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.â€ And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourietill I thought my linen would get on fire.

I stood looking at him a moment.
